# Payment Microservice 
Tracks app premium users and their subscriptions. Links app user ID with Stripe User ID and Stripe subscription ID. 
___
## Setup 
To test locally, download the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) and set it to forward events to the app 

`stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5000/webhook`

You can then trigger Stripe events to simulate successful subscriptions 

`stripe trigger customer.subscription.created`

When deployed, a Stripe account will be set up to forward customer.subscription.created events to the deployed endpoint 

## To run 
Build
`docker build -t chuenkaiong/paymentms:1.0 .`

`docker compose up`

Use browser to access http://localhost:5000/create-checkout-session. The server returns a redirect to a Stripe subscription checkout page. Enter testing payment details (card number 4242 4242 4242 4242) plus a validly formatted email and an expiry date in the future. You are then redirected to a success page (currently set to this server's list all users page for convenience, but should be changed to an actual success page on the frontend).

## Todos
- Deploy DB and change DB URL in container 
- Setup webhook secret in app.py
- Change webhook redirects
